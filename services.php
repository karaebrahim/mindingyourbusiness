                            <p>Our office works with small- to medium-sized service-related companies, startups, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, retail operations, and/or home-based enterprises. Our offerings include full-cycle to partial-service bookkeeping, depending on your needs. One-time or year-end projects are always welcome. We work closely with your tax accountant in order that your records are properly positioned for tax preparation purposes, which results in timely filing of all government, payroll, federal, and state required forms.</p>

We can accommodate whatever frequency works best for your business, at an affordable rate. Our software can support any pre-tax products, HSA or Flexible Spending plans, Garnishments, Paid-Time Off, Comp-as-you-Go, and more. We handle payroll deposits, Quarterly/Annual Tax Filings, and year-end W2s, all through our customized electronic portal.</p>

                            <p>QuickBooks training and general all-around record-keeping education is certainly available to all of our clients. We can guide you as you navigate the bookkeeping software, elevating your knowledge to a level of self-application. We are also available on a consulting basis, ready to answer your questions or help with your bookkeeping issues. Training can be customized to your level of knowledge of the accounting cycle. It is most rewarding when our clients slowly begin to master their own business accounting needs.</p>
